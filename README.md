# Bots Spectator

Web based visualization tool for [Bots](https://github.com/markusfisch/bots).<br> 
It allows to view stored replays or to connect to a spectator port of a running bots server to see a match live.<br>
It's also useful for debugging your own bot. 

You can [launch it directly here](https://christiannorbertbraun.github.io/bots_spectator/).

You can also [load an example replay](http://bots.cdietze.de/?replay_url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChristianNorbertBraun/bots_spectator/master/examples/boom.json).


## Development

You need to have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed.<br>
In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

Downloads all dependencies.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so a lot of that documentation applies.
